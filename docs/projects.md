# Active Projects

The Open Working Group supports, sponsors and organizes thought leadership and resources around open source projects that promise to contribute a positive impact to the communities we collectively serve.

## Open Authenticator <Badge type="info" text="development" />

[Open Authenticator](https://openworkinggroup.org/open-authenticator) is an open source no-frills, purpose built, multi-factor authentication application.

Ionic was used to provide the scaffolding for a consistently native cross platform user experience while Angular was selected as the primary framework to implement the HOTP/TOTP protocols as a web-application creating a common code base that can be transpiled and deployed natively to any device or operating system.

### Auth#Waffle <Badge type="info" text="development" />

[Auth#Waffle](https://authwaffle.app) productionalizes the work of the Open Authenticator project by providing and supporting a cross platform build and deployment ecosystem.

## OpenGIX <Badge type="info" text="development" />

[OpenGIX](https://opengix.org) is a protocol for working with layered geometry and arbitrary use case specific data. **Geometrical** **Interpolation** and **Transformation** (GIX) organizes `GeoJSON` and `TopoJSON` data into a layered document for data scientits and developers to visually or manually interact with and transform complex data objects to build shapes and maps filled with data.

The [OpenGIX Schema](https://github.com/OpenGIX/schema) was produced to define the structure for these complex layered files (`.gix`, `.gix.yaml|yml`, `.gix.json`).

The [VS Code Extension](https://github.com/OpenGIX/vscode-extension) was developed to implement the OpenGIX schema in a way that is visually interactive. And, this [web editor](https://github.com/OpenGIX/editor) is a contarized sandbox built with Angular to provide a modular implemenation for cross platform applications.

## TrendBender <Badge type="tip" text="proposal"  />

TrendBender is currenty in a draft proposal phase with some minor proof-of-concept work in development. The concept is simple though: combine historical data models with a given users behavior to inform on or perform some action. TradeBender is the intended commercial offering who's OptSwitch product will help traders perform extended trading actions outside of the traditional stop loss-like controls.
