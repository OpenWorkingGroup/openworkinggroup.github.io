# Communities

Communities get things done. This is why we aspire to build communities around all of the work that we do—and there's only one requirement to join: ==works well with others==.

## Open Wine Intiative

The Open Wine Initiative is a consortium organized by a common interest—wine! :wine_glass:

While the Open Wine Initiative organizes the community, the [Open Wine Project](https://openwineproject.org) organizes its efforts. Two such efforts are underway to establish standards in wine ontology and geography. Visit [Open Wine Maps](https://openwinemaps.org) to learn more about the projects effort to map the world of wine and the [Wine Ontology](https://openwineproject.org/docs/ontology.html) project to help establish wine language standards.

## BuyersBeware.org

[BuyersBeware.org](https://buyersbeware.org) was created to advocate for consumer rights when organizations are misleading or neglegent, when they fail to deliver on advertised goods or services, obfiscate atypical policies, or otherwise take advantage of customers.
